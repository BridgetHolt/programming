    "**Q1.** First, think about your priorities in life. What kind of salary do you want to make after graduation? Do you mind getting more schooling? What kind of work-life balance are you looking for? Where do you want to work, geographically? You don't have to write this down here, just think about it.\n",

    "1. Go to the Occupational Outlook Handbook at [https://www.bls.gov/ooh/](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/). Look up \"Data Scientist.\" Read about the job and start collecting data about it from the job profile (e.g. salary, education required, work setting)\n",
